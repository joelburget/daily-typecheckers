# I'm writing a typechecker every day

... deliberately practicing something I want to be more of an expert in.

## Ideas I'd like to try

* linear
* compilation (registers, etc)
* toggle HOAS / bidirectional knobs
* ABTs
* data types!
* effects
* equality / homotopy
* reflection
* propagators
* pattern matching
* universe hierarchies
* subtyping

| Day | Date | Summary |
| :-- | :--- | :------ |
| 1 | Apr 5 | inspiration: https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/tcbe/blob/master/nosubst.md |
| 2 | Apr 6 | Was going to get data types working, but just made it to nat lits. This day turned out to be mostly about exploring the representation from the article linked in Day 1. |
| 3 | Apr 6 | refinements to day 2 |
| 4 | Apr 7 | first cut at representing data types |
| 5 | Apr 8 | Day 4 + pattern matching, typechecking, elimination |
| 6 | Apr 9 | Day 5 + pretty printing |
| 7 | Apr 10 | Experiment with four binder representations from [Chargueraud's locally nameless survey](http://www.chargueraud.org/research/2009/ln/main.pdf) |
